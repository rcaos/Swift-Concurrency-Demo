This repository contains a collection of tiny examples that demonstrate the new concurrency features introduced in the Swift programming language starting from Swift 5.5 in 2021. 

These examples are designed to help you understand and utilize Swift's concurrency APIs effectively.

## Examples
The repository contains a variety of examples, each focusing on different aspects of Swift's concurrency features. Some of the examples you'll find include:

- Use built in apis like URLSession
- Convert your callbacks (completion handlers) to async-await
- Convert your delegate base components to async-await
- Structured concurrency (Async-let)
- Structured concurrency (Group of tasks)
- Unstructured Tasks
- AsyncStream
- Task cancellation
- Reliably Testing
